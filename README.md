# ShellShock
ShellShock is a semi-sentient, passive-aggressive desktop companion that lives on your screen to manage your productivity. It’s not just a pet; it’s an OS-aware assistant that roasts your distractions, compliments your "deep work," and forces you into high-intensity "micro-breaks" via an integrated Flappy Bird-style game.
