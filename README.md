Project Description :
ShellShock is a semi-sentient, passive-aggressive desktop companion that lives on your screen to manage your productivity. It’s not just a pet; it’s an OS-aware assistant that roasts your distractions, compliments your "deep work," and forces you into high-intensity "micro-breaks" via an integrated Flappy Bird-style game.

The Problem statement
In an era of remote work and complex coding, developers fall victim to two main productivity killers:

* *The "Stare-Down":* Getting stuck on a bug and staring at the screen for 20 minutes without a single mouse move (Analysis Paralysis).
* *The "Social Media Rabbit Hole":* Taking a "quick break" on YouTube or Reddit that accidentally lasts two hours because there’s no "hard stop."
* *Dry Productivity Tools:* Standard Pomodoro timers are easy to ignore and lack the personality needed to actually engage a developer.

The Solution :
solves this by providing a "Human-In-The-Loop" desktop experience:

1. *Context-Aware Personality:* It uses system-level window tracking to know if you are in VS Code (Compliments) or YouTube (Insults).
2. *Inactivity Intervention:* If you don't move your mouse for a set time, the pet *physically shakes your screen* ("knocking") to wake you up.
3. *The Gamified Circuit Breaker:* It provides a 60-second "Focus Game" that is intense enough to reset your brain but short enough to keep you on track. The game *force-closes itself* when the timer ends to push you back into your IDE.
